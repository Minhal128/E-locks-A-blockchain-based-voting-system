I have designed this program for myself and for others,it is made in the C language .It's special feature is that I have developed a python module in it,and the main thing is that about this program is whenever I feel that something is taking time like when I open Google chrome or any other app so it's take time to open ,or when I want to open a website it takes time to search for it.So,to save that time I have developed this program.For example If I write 'Open NED website' it will directly open the website for me.<p/>

```

<h2 align="center">Working </h2>
<p>
<h3><li>User-Defined Headers</li></h3>

We used User-defined header files for containing declaration of functions, variables and other elements that can be reused across multiple source code files...</p>
<h3><li>Nested Loop</li></h3>

We used Nested Loop structure to connect our code & to create pattern for the genertation to-do list...
</p>
<h3><li>srand function</li></h3>

Used srand function to random generate of Quote and Joke..</p>
<h3><li>Functions</li></h3>

Execute at every call  ....</p>
