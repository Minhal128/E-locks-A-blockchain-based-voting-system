<p>
I have developed a C++ application integrating facial recognition with a blockchain-based voting system, utilizing OpenCV for real-time face detection and recognition. The program allows users to register their details, including name, age, CNIC, and political party, which are securely encrypted and stored. It employs a custom SimpleEncryption class for data encryption and blockchain technology to create tamper-proof logs of user interactions. Users are prompted to enter their details interactively, and the application saves captured images and encrypted data in specified paths. This system ensures data privacy, transparency, and security, making it a robust solution for secure voting and user verification. Contributions to enhance its features and functionality are welcome.<p/>

<h1 align="center" id="title">Disclaimer</h1>
<p>This C++ program, designed and developed by Syed Muhammad Minhal Rizvi, enhances efficiency by providing quick access to frequently used applications and websites through facial recognition, encryption, and blockchain concepts using OpenCV. The program captures live video, detects faces, and allows users to input details for each detected face, which are then encrypted and saved. It employs XOR-based encryption for user data, decrypts it for display, and logs entries with block numbers, hashes, and timestamps. While efforts have been made to ensure reliability and security, users are advised to use the program responsibly and acknowledge its provided as-is without guarantees. The program operates based on user commands, automating tasks to optimize time, though effectiveness may vary based on system configurations and external factors.</p>

<h2>üõ† Installation Steps:</h2>

<p>1. Clone the repository</p>

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Minhal128/E-locks-A-blockchain-based-voting-system.git
```
<p>2. Set the path in Visual studio for OpenCV </p>
here is the way that how I setup the OpenCV in visual studio 

<p>2. Install & Run C Language modules</p>

```bash
  install-- gcc -o project project.c
```

```bash
  run-- ./project.exe
```

<h2 align="center">Working </h2>
<p>
<h3><li>User-Defined Headers</li></h3>

We used User-defined header files for containing declaration of functions, variables and other elements that can be reused across multiple source code files...</p>
<h3><li>Nested Loop</li></h3>

We used Nested Loop structure to connect our code & to create pattern for the genertation to-do list...
</p>
<h3><li>srand function</li></h3>

Used srand function to random generate of Quote and Joke..</p>
<h3><li>Functions</li></h3>

Execute at every call  ....</p>
